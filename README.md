> Big warning! This is a random part of a education project published just to get a nice github pages website to discuss the UI prototype!

```shell
npm install && npx vite
```
  - open http://localhost:5173/ to see your app

For all future runs, you just need
```shell
npx vite
```

To update the preview website
```shell
npm run deploy
```
